**BucketReef** is an open-source web application to manage S3-compatible object storage primarily focused on **Ceph RGW**.

> Project status: **Beta**. Suitable for evaluation and controlled deployments.

It gives storage administrators and delegated team managers a single interface to manage their storage environments.
It can also be used solely through the integrated S3 browser for direct object access.


## Workspaces summary

- **Admin**: platform governance, endpoints, users, and settings.
- **Manager**: bucket and IAM administration in account context.
- **Browser**: direct object operations.
- **Portal**: explicit self-service workspace backed by RGW IAM.
- **Ceph-admin**: Ceph RGW cluster-wide administration.

## Workspace features

### Admin

  <img src="doc/docs/assets/screenshots/user/user-overview.light.png" alt="Admin dashboard" width="560">
</a>

- Manage UI users, roles, and workspace entitlements.
- Administer RGW accounts, S3 users, and S3 connections.
- Register storage endpoints and review endpoint status.
- Access audit trails and platform-wide settings.

### Manager

  <img src="doc/docs/assets/screenshots/user/workspace-manager.light.png" alt="Manager buckets" width="560">
</a>

- Create and configure buckets with versioning, lifecycle, quotas, CORS, and access controls.
- Manage IAM users, groups, roles, policies, and access keys.
- Operate SNS topics when the selected endpoint supports notifications.
- Use migration and comparison tools for bucket alignment and controlled transfers.

### Browser

  <img src="doc/docs/assets/screenshots/user/workspace-browser.light.png" alt="S3 browser" width="560">
</a>

- Browse buckets, prefixes, and objects from the selected context.
- Upload, download, preview, delete, and restore objects and versions.
- Run bulk operations on large object selections.
- Inspect and update object metadata and tags directly from the UI.

### Ceph-admin

<a href="https://ksperis.github.io/bucketreef/user/screenshots-gallery/#ceph-admin">
  <img src="doc/docs/assets/screenshots/user/workspace-ceph-admin.light.png" alt="Ceph Admin" width="560">
</a>

- Manage Ceph RGW accounts and users at cluster scope.
- Inspect bucket inventory and apply bucket-level configuration centrally.
- Monitor endpoint metrics for operational visibility.
- Run long-running bulk actions with explicit progress and failure counters.

### Portal

<a href="https://ksperis.github.io/bucketreef/user/screenshots-gallery/#portal">
  <img src="doc/docs/assets/screenshots/user/workspace-portal.light.png" alt="Portal" width="560">
</a>

- Self-service dashboard for eligible Ceph RGW accounts with IAM enabled.
- Access is explicit per account with `portal_user` or `portal_manager`.
- `/manager` access remains separate and still requires account admin/root links.

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

For a local evaluation from a clean machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ksperis/bucketreef.git
cd bucketreef
./quickstart
```

The script generates strong local secrets in `.env.quickstart`, builds the
backend and frontend from the current checkout, waits for both services, then
prints a 15-minute one-time URL. The first build can take several minutes.
Open the URL to create the first administrator and enroll a passkey. Re-running
the script is safe and prints either a fresh setup URL or the sign-in URL.

This quickstart is intentionally limited to loopback, SQLite and local
evaluation. It includes no MinIO, no simulated or preconfigured storage, and no
scheduler. Connect an existing S3-compatible or Ceph RGW endpoint later from
Admin if you want to exercise storage workflows. A complete deployment enables
the `operations` Compose profile and uses a reverse proxy with TLS.

Useful commands:

```bash
./quickstart status
./quickstart stop
./quickstart reset
```

See the [Quickstart guide](https://ksperis.github.io/bucketreef/ops/quickstart/)
for reset backups, restore steps, expired links and deployment boundaries.

## Fork images (简体中文版本)

This fork publishes its own images through **Publish fork images to GHCR** in
GitHub Actions. The upstream `publish-ghcr.yml` remains a metadata-only workflow;
upstream official releases continue to use GitLab CI.

| Component | Fork image |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | `ghcr.io/sqkkyzx/bucketreef-backend:latest` |
| Frontend | `ghcr.io/sqkkyzx/bucketreef-frontend:latest` |
| Scheduler | `ghcr.io/sqkkyzx/bucketreef-scheduler:latest` |

- Changes under `backend/`, `frontend/`, `scheduler/`, `ops/cron/`, or the image
  workflow on `main` trigger all three builds after `npm run check` passes.
  Each image supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.
- Main builds publish `main`, `latest`, and `sha-<full commit SHA>` tags.
- Pushing a `v*` Git tag publishes that exact tag (for example `v0.2.4-zh.1`)
  plus the SHA tag, without changing `latest`.
- **Run workflow** builds the selected branch or tag. Only `main` updates
  `latest`; other branches receive `branch-<sanitized branch name>` and the SHA
  tag. Manually selecting a non-`v*` tag publishes only the SHA tag.
- Authentication uses the repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `packages: write`;
  no additional PAT or registry secret is required. If fork workflows are
  disabled, enable them in the repository's **Actions** tab first.
- Newly created GHCR packages may be private. To allow unauthenticated pulls,
  set each package's visibility to public in its package settings. If an image
  name already exists, grant this repository Actions access to that package.

Wait for all three publish jobs to succeed before deploying. Use matching SHA
or release tags for a consistent set of images. The Chinese locale changes
require both the fork frontend and backend. Build and publish does not update
an existing deployment automatically.

The workflow is restricted to `sqkkyzx/bucketreef`; change that guard when
reusing it in another fork. To validate workflow syntax locally, run:

```bash
actionlint .github/workflows/publish-fork-images.yml
```
