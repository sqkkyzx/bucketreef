# Portal: Settings

Use this page to review the effective configuration of the project currently
selected in the Portal. A Portal Manager can also edit the project override when
an administrator has delegated this responsibility.

## When to use

Use **Portal > Settings** to confirm the selected project, your access level,
the storage service, and the effective Portal
capabilities and Storage Space defaults. Personal identity, display preferences,
alerts, and password settings are managed from **User profile**.

## Prerequisites

- Portal is enabled.
- You have an explicit **Portal user** or **Portal manager** role in the
  selected project, directly or through a UI group.
- The selected project is available in the Portal.

## Steps

1. Open **Portal > Settings**.
2. Confirm the selected project.
3. Review your workspace access and the associated storage service.
4. Review **Currently applied** values and their **Platform** or **Project** origin.
   Storage usage and space counts remain on the dashboard.
5. If you can edit, choose **Platform value**, **Enabled**, or **Disabled**.
   Turn on **Customize** for retention days or CORS origins. **Configure** opens
   a CORS draft; **Apply** copies it into the page without saving to the server.
6. **Save changes** applies the complete page draft. **Cancel** discards it
   after confirmation. **Restore platform values** prepares a reset in the
   draft; review it and save to apply it. New-space defaults do not change
   existing Storage Spaces.

## Expected result

Every Portal project member sees the effective values. Portal Users and
non-delegated Portal Managers cannot change the controls. A delegated Portal
Manager can update the single shared project override also shown in Admin.

**Account administrator** is a separate Manager role: it grants neither Portal
membership nor permission to edit Portal settings. A person with both roles
uses their Portal role here, regardless of their Manager rights.

## You are done when

The project context and effective settings match the workspace you intended to
review. If you are delegated, saving the draft updates the page
with the resulting effective values.

Administrators use the same editor in **Admin > RGW Accounts > Portal settings**,
with an additional delegation switch. Restoring platform values does not change
delegation. Portal and other account changes are saved independently.

Changes remain in the form if saving fails. If another editor changed a value
you also edited, the page reports a conflict instead of overwriting it. Cancel
to load the current values. Changing project or leaving a modified form asks
for confirmation before switching the active project.

The page and its dialogs follow your profile language (English, French, German or
Simplified Chinese), including automatic language selection. Currently applied inherited
values are refreshed after saving; an overridden platform default is not
available for preview through the project API.

## If you do not see this action

If settings are read-only, either your project role is not Portal Manager or an
administrator has not enabled delegation for this project. Existing overrides
remain effective when delegation is disabled. Use **User profile** for personal
settings or ask an administrator to review the project configuration.

## Limits / feature flags

!!! note
    Delegation never creates a second settings layer: Admin and delegated Portal
    Managers edit the same project override. Project defaults affect newly
    created Storage Spaces only; use the Settings tab of an existing Space to
    change its file-version retention, automatic history cleanup, or retention period.
